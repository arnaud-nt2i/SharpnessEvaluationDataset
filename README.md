# SharpnessEvaluationDataset
SharpnessReclassificationDataset contains images of vaginal smear sections taken at various focus levels.

This dataset includes 10 images from each side of the optimal focus, with a constant defocus step.

It is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new sharpness evaluation tool within the logarithmic image processing framework (LIP), enabling the reclassification of images based on sharpness and paving the way for new autofocus tools.
